There was a big scary bear headed towards the hikers in the woods.
The hikers ran away, unknowingly headed towards a pack of wolves.
The hikers then decided to run away again, unknowingly headed towards a troll.
Luckily for the hikers they were totally equipped to deal with a troll. The hikers, in fact, were highly awarded troll fighters.
With the trolls mercilessly butchered and since they had no prisoners the group of hikers decided to continue on their weekend hike.
 After a few hours walk and almost out of water at this point. They came upon a beautiful fountain, where other hikers gather. 
 It had been such a crazy day they decided to set camp.
