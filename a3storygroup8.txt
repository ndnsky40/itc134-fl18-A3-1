There was a big scary bear headed towards the hikers in the woods. The hikers ran away, unknowingly headed towards a pack of wolves. The hikers then decided to run away again, unknowingly headed towards a troll.
Luckily for the hikers they were totally equipped to deal with a troll. The hikers, in fact, were highly awarded troll fighters.
